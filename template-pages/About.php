                      <p><small>Dawn is the stepdaughter of Robert Sugarman, the Founder of Tequipment.  Although she spent years working in finance, property management, and project management, she made sure to stay informed of the progress and growth of the family business. Eventually, she decided to take an active role and joined the staff, gaining experience in all departments.  She ultimately chose professional development and learning as her focus. A new company, Teaching Things, was formed as an offshoot of Tequipment to ensure a clear focus on teaching and learning services, and a team dedicated to delivering exceptional results for the educational community. As the head of this new company, Dawn unites her diverse business experiences and acumen with her in-depth knowledge of the company.
